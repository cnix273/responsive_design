                <p>“Fashion is not something that exists in dresses only. Fashion is in the sky, in the street, fashion has to do with ideas, the way we live, what is happening.” - Coco Channel</p>
                <p>I am an outgoing, curious, and passionate 22-year-old living in LA that has always been drawn towards art, beauty, makeup, and fashion. I believe that beauty and inspiration can be found in every facet of life, every experience.</p>
                <p>I find joy in the subtle art of drawing on this inspiration to curate a striking yet well-balanced look, expressing myself through clothes and accessories. I love the way that accessories can perfectly round-out a look. I also am very passionate about makeup and skincare, having worked at ULTA Beauty for over a year.</p>
                <p>I am excited to share with others this understanding of the world and the beauty within it. I seek to help others find confidence and realize their inner beauty through their outward appearance. You only get one chance at a good first impression and it starts with your outfit.</p>
                <p>Feel free to take a look at my portfolio page to discover some of my favorite looks I have curated on myself and others. I also have a contact page for any and all inquiries. I look forward to helping you discover your true self and beauty and allowing you share that with the world through your style.</p>
